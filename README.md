## Definition
  Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

## Description
  Our project have for purpose to recognize monkeys from images. And the model will be build with only pytorch and python
  The images are matrix of 3 Dimensions because they are in color (Red Breen Blue)

## Data
  We have like 15 images Of monkeys by species. This images will be our training to recognize and we have like 10 images of 
monkeys by species that we will use to test our model.

## Important
More you increase num_epochs variable more the network neurone will be accurate and will learn well. But that will take long before you get the predictions.
